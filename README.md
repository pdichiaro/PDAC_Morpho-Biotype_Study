# PDAC_Morpho-Biotype_Study
A repository of code for data analysis/processing generated for the PDAC Morpho-Biotype Study.

The study was performed at the Transcriptional Control in Cancer Lab at European Institute of Oncology (IEO). These data contains transcriptional profiles of multiple tumor areas (200-500 cells) dissected by Laser Micro-dissection (LMD) from primary patients affected by Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC).

Primary findings related to the identification of coexisting Morpho-Biotype in PDAC were published here: https://www.cell.com/cancer-cell/fulltext/S1535-6108(24)00079-5

The GEO SuperSeries can be found here: [GSE209952](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE209952) 

Count matrices, meta data tables and R objects useful for the data analysis are deposited on Zenodo.  DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.12680172
